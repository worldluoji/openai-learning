要使用一些开源模型，但不是所有人的电脑里都有一个强劲的 NVidia GPU 的。所以，建议你通过 Colab 来运行对应的 Notebook，并且注意，要把对应的运行环境设置成 GPU。

There are several products similar to Google Colab that you can use for data science and machine learning projects. Some of them include Kaggle Kernels, Azure Notebooks, Deepnote, and Noteable123. These platforms offer free cloud-based Jupyter notebooks and GPUs that you can use for your projects. They also come with many Python packages preinstalled, making it easier for you to get started with your work.
